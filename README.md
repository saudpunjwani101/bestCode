# bestCode


it's a simple api that I created in react-native using offline local database Realm.

Start with the storageManager and the comments will lead where to go next to understand the code better. It's not a complete api yet, but the way I managed to use one base class for all the tables in Realm is the best thing about this code, using inheritence...
